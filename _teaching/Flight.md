This project adopted a flexible and iterative approach to create a smart flight check-in kiosk. This innovative system aimed to expedite the airport check-in process, delivering an enhanced user experience. I played a key role in the technical development, utilizing Scrum methodologies to navigate the project through planning, development sprints, and quality assessments.
